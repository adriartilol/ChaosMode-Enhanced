# CHAOS MODE

## Features

- Safe room is not so safe
- The detonator handle and the dynamite are put in random places
- Other quest items like the chain cutters and the wrench (and others) are randomply places in the maps.
- The generator could break in the middle of a game and of course you would need to repair it to progress
- There is no place where the Stalker could not be. Even in the tunnels!
- Removed all the notes of the official story (I mean do you need to know for the Nth time that the protagonist pissed in the flask of Lambert?). Added random notes to tell you where the quest items are located, put some other notes to explain you the new features and give tips.
- Corpses and eventually dog tags are now put in random places. They could be already burnt or not burnt, with rats eating them.

## Future features

- Random paths: randomly put obstacles or locked not breakable doors modifying the standard layout
- Later in the game spawn Toussaint randomly in one of the maps
- Food and thirst system
- Fuel cistern in random places
