# CHAOS MODE

## Features

- Quick start in the safe room
- Safe room is not so safe
- The detonator handle and the dynamite are put in random places
- Other quest items like the chain cutters and the wrench (and others) are randomly placed in the maps.
- The generator could break in the middle of a game and of course you would need to repair it to progress
- There is no place where the Stalker could not be. Even in the tunnels!
- Removed all the notes of the official story (I mean do you need to know for the Nth time that Lambert pissed in Henri's flask?). Added random notes to tell you where the quest items are located, plus some other notes to explain you the new features and give tips and also a bunch of classic notes.
- No arena, after you blow up the debris, you actually escape the bunker!

## How to start

Due probably to a bug in the standard game, you can't start the game using the Custom stories menu.

- Unzip the content of this zip file, inside the mods folder of your local Amnesia The Bunker installation (it should be like "<my Steam folder>\steamapps\common\Amnesia The Bunker\mods")
- Copy the "RunChaosMode.bat" file inside the "ChaosMode" folder in the main folder of the game (it should be like "<my Steam folder>\steamapps\common\Amnesia The Bunker)
- Start the game by clicking on "RunChaosMode.bat"

I guess the https://wiki.frictionalgames.com/page/HPL3/Third_Party_Tools/HPL3_Mod_Manager should work too

Any kind of addon that modify the Stalker behaviour, the randomization and anything related to this mod (check the features) is considered not compatible with this mod.

## Known bugs

- Can't start the mod from Custom stories menu in standard game
- The wrench is spawned in strange position

## Future features

- Replace some of the classic notes with something new (just story stuff)
- Put some dogtags code in randomly placed notes
- Corpses and eventually dog tags are now put in random places. They could be already burnt or not burnt, with rats eating them.
- Random paths: randomly put obstacles or locked not breakable doors modifying the standard layout
- Later in the game spawn Toussaint randomly in one of the maps, hunting you
- Food and thirst system
- Fuel cistern in random places
